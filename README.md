Predicting Miami 2017 Marathon winner with Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Linear Regression

Given the raw data from previous year's of Marathons, predict the winner of Miami Marathon 2017.  This project has Logistic Regression (implemented in R) , Naive Bayes(python) and Linear Regresssion(Python) built from scratch. It preprocesses the data to remove any noisy data and to normalize the data suitable for the classifiers. 

Results: 
 Linear Regression performed amazingly. It had an error of 1-2 mins in predicting the running time for rach player. 
 
 Naive Bayes predictions are more accurate than logistic regression. 
 
 *Winner Prediction*
 
 It predicted the 1st runner up as the winner. :D
